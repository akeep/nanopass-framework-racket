Nanopass Has Moved
==================
The Nanopass framework for Racket has moved to its own github group. This one
will no longer get updates. You can find the new repo here:

https://github.com/nanopass/nanopass-framework-racket

Additional information can be found at the nanopass website:

Nanopass Compiler Library
==========================

This repositiory contains a Racket version of the Nanopass Compiler
Infrastructure described in \[1, 2, 3, 4\], along with the beginnings of a test
compiler for the library and the rough start to a users guide.  The nanopass
framework for Racket has been tested on Racket version 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, and the
current development version.  An R6RS Scheme version also exists which support
Chez Scheme, Vicare Scheme, and Ikarus Scheme.
